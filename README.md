# Data Visualization Final Project

This project contains a Juppyter notebook that has all the analysis of the Urbana-Champaign Crime data.
There are 3 interactive plots (plotly, bqplot etc.) that are not visible by default. You might need to run this notebook locally to see all the visualizations. In that case, you will need to download the dataset from https://data.urbanaillinois.us/Police/Urbana-Police-Arrests-Since-1988/afbd-8beq
Thank you!
